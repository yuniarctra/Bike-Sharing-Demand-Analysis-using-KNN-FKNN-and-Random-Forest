# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Analysis-using-KNN-FKNN-and-Random-Forest
A short comparative analysis of the Bike Sharing dataset using KNN, FKNN, and Random Forest to predict bike rental demand and evaluate model performance.

## Overview
This repository contains a comparative analysis of the Bike Sharing dataset using three machine learning methods:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbors (FKNN)
- Random Forest

The goal of this project is to predict bike rental demand and evaluate the performance of each model.
All analyses were carried out using Python, including preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bike Sharing Dataset

## Workflow
- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature preprocessing and normalization
- Model training (KNN, FKNN, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Conclusion and insights
- Evaluation Metrics
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score

## Results
A comparison of the three algorithms was performed to determine which model best predicts bike rental demand.
